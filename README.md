# More Visible Pole Plant / 更明显的拟态草

Spotting a **Pole Plant** on a Steam Deck OLED (especially with the etched glass/matte screen) can be a nightmare. After several near-heart attacks from being "pole-bushed," I decided to create this mod to make survival a bit more manageable.

This mod allows you to customize the appearance of Pole Plants so you can actually see them before it's too late.

## **Features & Options:**

1. **Simple Mode:** Adds a subtle 30% red tint to every Pole Plant. It keeps the game's atmosphere while making them stand out just enough.
2. **Advanced Customization:** Fully define the colors for both the **poles** and **leaves** using an in-game color picker. Includes a "Breathing" effect for that eerie, living vibe.
3. **RGB Disco Mode:** Cycles through the full spectrum of colors. Turn the wasteland into a dance floor and add a touch of comedy to your inevitable demise.

## **Compatibility & Performance:**

- **Multiplayer:** Tested in **Rain Meadow** with friends—works perfectly fine!
- **Performance:** This is a lightweight mod with negligible impact on your FPS.

**Note:** This mod was primarily created for my personal enjoyment and better visibility on handheld. While it hasn't undergone "industrial-grade" testing, I'm sharing it here in case anyone else finds it helpful. Use it, have fun, and stay alive!️

在SteamDeck Oled磨砂屏上看出一根拟态草太困难了，为了不把自己吓出心脏病来我做了这个mod，方便识别。

提供三种选项：

1. 简单模式。只是简单地在每根拟态草上添加30%的红色混色，让拟态草看起来更明显
2. 高级自定义。你可以通过色板随心定义拟态草的颜色，包括杆子和叶子，支持呼吸灯效果。
3. RGB灯效循环，让你仿佛进入迪厅，为死亡添加一点喜剧色彩

我在和朋友雨甸联机时使用了，目前没有问题，这只是一个小mod，性能开销很小

**注意：** 我还没有经过特别详尽的测试，因为这主要是为了我的个人体验和好玩，但我假设也有人需要它所以上传
